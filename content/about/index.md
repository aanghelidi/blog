Hi! My name is Alain Anghelidi. I'm a former Data Scientist currently working
as an MLOps Engineer whose goal is to build robust and efficient machine learning systems into production.

I have a background in **aerospace engineering** where I studied **autonomous
airborne systems**. Then I became interested in **predictive maintenance** using various artificial
intelligence techniques applied to aviation. I later expanded this skill to
industry in general.

## Favorite programming languages
- [Python](https://www.python.org/), my day to day language
- and [Golang](https://go.dev/), that I learned recently and find really well designed

## Favorite editors:
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), for long sessions of work
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), for everything else
