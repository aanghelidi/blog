Hi! My name is Alain Anghelidi. I'm a former Data Scientist currently working
as a Machine Learning Engineer whose goal is to build robust and efficient machine learning systems into production.

I have a background in **aerospace engineering** where I studied **autonomous
airborne systems**. Then I became interested in **predictive maintenance** using various artificial
intelligence techniques applied to aviation. I later expanded this skill to
industry in general.

## Favorite programming languages
- [Python](https://www.python.org/), my day to day language
