## Hello World Again

This post is one of my many attempts to start this blog. Multiple times, I dropped. Lack of motivation? Discipline?
I don't know, but the results are here, I dropped.

This time I want to commit and stick to it.

### Why?

Speaking of motivation, what are my motivations?

Over the years, I found a lot of great blog post articles that helped me and find the information I needed.
I always thought:

> One day I should do the same, if not for others, at least for myself

Also, for some reason, whenever I explain a subject, I end up with a much deeper understanding of it.
That alone should be a good enough motivation. This is the so-called [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/):

1. Select a concept to learn.
2. Teach it to a child.
3. Review and refine your understanding.
4. Organize your notes and revisit them regularly.

Let's apply this technique by slightly modifying it to fit into the context of this blog:

1. Select a concept to learn.
2. Write a blog post about it.
3. Review the post and research until I can express it clearly so that the reader can understand it.
4. Organize my notes and revisit them regularly.

I also want to improve my writing skills. I believe that communicating his ideas is an essential skill.
How many times have I found myself reading a blog post/documentation/article and thinking:

> This makes no sense, I don't understand anything

Perhaps, you will feel that way reading this post. If so, please let me know, and I will try to improve.

I believe in [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)), and I think that writing in public will lead me in the right direction.

### How?

I will contribute to this blog in 2 different ways:

* [TIL](/til/): The `Today I Learned` is a collection of short posts about things I learned that caught my attention.
* [Posts](/posts/): The `Posts` are more in-depth articles about a specific subject.

Both aim to bring valuable insights to the reader.

## Final words
This post is mostly a reminder to myself to keep going and not drop this time but if you read it, I hope you enjoyed it and that you will come back later to read my new posts.
