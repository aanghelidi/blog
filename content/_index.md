# Welcome to my blog 

Hello I'm Alain.

I currently work as a Machine Learning engineer in the aerospace industry. My goal is to build robust and efficient machine learning systems into production. 

I like to apply software engineering best practices (especially testing) and I am always eager to learn new subjects.

This blog is the place where I share my thoughts on machine learning, software engineering, programming languages and other topics that I find interesting. I also intend to use it as a way to keep track of my progress in my learning journey as well as improving my writing.
