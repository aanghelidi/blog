## [TIL] How to transfer a repository from Gitlab to Github

Today I learned how to transfer a repo from Gitlab to Github.
The process is relatively straightforward and involves the following steps:

1. Open your github main profile page.
2. Click on the `+` sign in the top right corner and select `Import repository`.
3. Enter the URL of the repo you want to import.
4. Click on `Begin import`.
5. (Optional) You might need to enter your credentials (email) and PAT (personal access token) with read permissions.
6. Wait for the import to finish.
